# Hello Arc Raiders From Godot

Learn how to code from Zero to Junior developer by playing at Arc Raider from Godot.
(If you plan to sell item outside of the game or harms player experience here, go way.) 


⚠️ Use any third party in most of the game is consider cheating and can lead to a ban ⚠️  
⚠️ I am not responsible of your ban when it is going to happen ( -> not if but when )⚠️  

You will need:
- an ESP32S3 to simulate joysticks
- an Pico2W to simulate keyboard
- a MiraBox to read the pixel on Screen
- two computes:
  - one to run the game on Window
  - one to learn how to code

You can decide to not buy the ESP32S3:
  - Then you do need:
    - XOMI to simulate Xbox controller
    - S2W to simulate Keyboard (not verified yet for the PostMessage)
    
More you use software to make learn code more you are detectable by anti-cheat. 
You risk a ban of the game.
